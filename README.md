# CPP_Applications
My solutions to some C++ problems.

## Topics:

`1`: Implementing a comprehensive banking system in C++, focusing on dynamic data structures and no memory leaks.

`2`: Analyzing and comparing the complexities of different solutions for the Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem using C++, aiming to understand the practical performance versus theoretical expectations.

`3`: Implementing a student registration system using doubly and singly linked lists in C++, focusing on data structure manipulation and memory management.

`4`: Converting infix to postfix expressions and evaluating them in C++, focusing on accuracy and efficiency without memory leaks.

`5`: Exploring sorting algorithms' efficiencies through practical analysis and implementation in C++, aiming for deeper insights into algorithmic performance and real-world applicability.

`6`: Analyzing BST performance with varying k-mer sizes in C++, focusing on time complexity and tree balance insights.

`7`: Crafting a simulation in C++ to determine the optimal number of doctors needed at the hospital, balancing staff costs with patient wait times using heap-based priority queues.

`8`: Implementing and comparing separate chaining and quadratic probing hash collision strategies in C++ for efficient k-mer storage and retrieval, focusing on performance analysis.
